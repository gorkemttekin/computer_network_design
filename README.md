# Computer Network Design with Cisco

This project was developed within the scope of the CET 314 computer network systems course. The aim of the project is to design an internet infrastructure for an imaginary campus using the Cisco Packet Tracer application. 
The design was carefully made according to the needs of the campus and the buildings on the campus, and a cost-effective internet system was distributed throughout the campus.
